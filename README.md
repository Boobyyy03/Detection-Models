# Face Detection Models

This repository contains implementations of basic face detection techniques using Haar cascades, FaceNet, and a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The aim is to help beginners understand the concepts and workings of face detection.

## Introduction
Face detection is a computer technology that determines the locations and sizes of human faces in digital images. It detects facial features and ignores anything else, such as buildings, trees, and bodies. This repository covers three different approaches:

1. **Haar Cascades**: A machine learning object detection method used to identify objects in images or videos. OpenCV provides pre-trained classifiers for face detection.

2. **FaceNet**: A deep learning model that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for face recognition and clustering.

3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification or regression challenges. Here, it is used in combination with FaceNet embeddings for face recognition.

## Installation
To use the code in this repository, you'll need to have Python installed. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Boobyyy03/Detection-Models.git
    cd Detection-Models
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
## Improving Model Accuracy
To improve the accuracy of the face detection models, it is crucial to gather more data. Here are some tips:
Diversify the Dataset: Include images with different lighting conditions, angles, and backgrounds.
Increase the Number of Samples: More images of each person will help the model learn better.
Data Augmentation: Apply transformations like rotation, scaling, and flipping to create variations of existing images.
By continuously adding diverse and high-quality data, you can significantly enhance the performance and accuracy of the face detection models.

## Summary
This repository provides basic implementations of face detection models using Haar cascades, FaceNet, and SVM. To achieve higher accuracy, it is essential to explore further, gather more data, and improve the models. By understanding and applying these basic concepts, you can build more precise face detection systems.
